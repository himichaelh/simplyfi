# Blog

Blogs include several pieces:
* weekly report on development (thought process) & story of fetures
* maybe write about investing (open portfolio for the world)
* addressing user questions (slowly build up FAQs)

Blogs should do the following:
* be timely but hopefully beyond (like Howard Marks memos)
* address problems in a no-bs way
* be authentic and honest

Launch in June 1st (or as soon as the individual accounts are done)
